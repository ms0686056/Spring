    <h1>Spring is Near! </h1>
    <p>The teacher wants us to add a paragraph with some text that is at least two sentences long. I will probably make it longer than two sentences and tell you what art project I did. I made a pixel drawing of a wolf on graph paper! It looks really cool! I just used a grey pencil to create it but next time I'll use more fun colors!</p>
